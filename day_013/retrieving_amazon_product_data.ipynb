       " 'Got the job done, enough said',\n",
       " 'Smells good',\n",
       " 'We have had such a moth infestation lately so I purchased these and so far so good.  I live the smell and the cute little pouches too',\n",
       " \"I love that these pouches are non-toxic and safe around pets. I've tried sprays and traps before, but this is by far the easiest and most effective solution. The roaches disappeared within weeks, and the fresh scent is a bonus. Will definitely repurchase!\",\n",
       " \"These may be effective but personally I have an aversion to the smell so had to get rid of them.... it's like old people smell with peppermint.  Not my thing.\",\n",
       " \"I used to be cool, and here I am writing reviews about moth repellents.\\n\\nAnyway, I store my sweaters in the attic in the summer. I don't know if I have moths, but I'm terrified my nice things are goign to look like swiss cheese when I pull them out again in the fall. But I'm also terrified of the moth ball scent. No one wants to smell like moth balls.\\n\\nI got these because they're made with natural oils, and they claimed not to smell like traditional moth balls (can confirm! They actually smell great). I love the little sachets. I spaced them out in the attic in the summer, and pulled out my things this fall ... and haven't found a single hole. And my clothes doesn't smell like moth balls. A win win, if you ask me.\",\n",
       " 'The natural method is my preference to avoid adding potentially harmful chemicals into the air at home.  I found these to be somewhat effective so far -- one closet was affected and seems to be free of moths since implementing these sachets.  Initially I put the sachet into closet without the included red cloth drawstring bag.  I had not realized these well made & vibrant red bags were part of the set, as these were at the bottom of the box it arrives in.\\n\\nWhen you intially open the enclosed plastic to use the sachet, the scent can be a bit overpowering, but not in an annoying way.  It makes me feel the product does work to repel the moths that could be present in the area.  It seems after 1 month the sachet loses the scent and should be replaced.  I will update once I have had these in use in my home for longer to evaluate more effectively on how well these work.',\n",
       " 'Traditional moth balls are typically made from either naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene, both toxic chemicals. Fortunately, there are natural and safe alternatives like these sachets from Peskegis. The pouches employ peppermint , cedar wood, clove and lemongrass oil to repel moths that destroy clothes and fabrics. I appreciate that they’re individually wrapped and retain their potency until opened. The product comes with 10 sachets sealed in plastic, plus 10 red velvet bags. The moth repellent is removed from its plastic wrapping, placed in the cloth bag, and hung or placed in the desired location. I did not find the scent very powerful or overwhelming. Hopefully, clothes moths have a sharper olfactory sense than I do and will stay away.',\n",
       " 'These moth repellent packets smell so much better than those chemical-smelling white moth balls and instead have a more natural essential oil smell. They kind of remind me of cologne, probably from the cedar. I was worried that it was going to make all of my clothes smell that way, but much of the scent has already cleared up in the past week. Each packet is individually sealed until ready to use and comes with a red storage pouch. It’s a bit early to tell how effective it really is at preventing clothing moths though.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t know if this is keeping the moths away, but it should. The smell is VERY potent. Not unpleasant...very \"mint-forward\" and intense. I\\'m not sure I want my clothes to smell like this year round, but I am really concerned about some expensive sweaters that the buggers love to munch on. We will see.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good value for what you get. This will last years...or can be used in many closets. I decided to use a pants hanger and just clipped it on so I could suspend the packet. My hope is that they won\\'t even enter the closet because it\\'s the first thing they will smell upon entering.',\n",
       " \"I don't have a moth issue but I don't want to have one in the future.  I really wasn't sure about these pouches. I've been traumatized by moth balls and was scared that these would smell like that too, Thankfully they don't. The smell is a mix of peppermint and wood so it's rather pleasant and not pungent at all. The 10 pouches come individually wrapped in plastic with 10 red pouches. When ready to use, just open the plastic and place the pouch in the bag and store. It's advised to place them 6-13 feet apart.\",\n",
       " 'I put this moth repellent in my walking closet. I do not see any more moths there, but are in other parts of my home. So, I also have to use a moth trap to eliminate them. If you want to repel moths, go for it. I would instead catch them and eliminate them.',\n",
       " \"These have a pretty good aroma, it's pepperminty and do have a little bit of a cedar smell, the velvet bags fit the pouch well and great for hanging on a hanger in a closet.\",\n",
       " 'Pros\\n- Natural ingredients ensure safe use around the house\\n- Provides long-term protection against moths\\n- Suitable for use in closets, clothes storage, and drawers\\n- Comes in a convenient 10-pack\\n- Easy to place and use\\n\\nCons\\n- Some users may find the scent too strong\\n- Scent will transfer onto items they come in contact with\\n- Regular replacement needed for continued effectiveness\\n- Limited effectiveness in large or open spaces\\n- Not suitable for those with allergies to certain natural ingredients',\n",
       " 'These don’t make my clothes smell like moth balls!!!! They do have a natural scent, and have been working fine (as far as I can tell) to keep the moths out of my closet and away from the wool pieces I hand knit. I hate the smell of moth balls, these are a good alternative! The little red satchels are cute and make for a perfect finishing touch. You just have to pull off the plastic and put the paper pouch inside, they are SO FAST to set up. Overall I really like these- they smell good, they work, and they don’t leave you with that grandma smell!',\n",
       " \"I honestly have no idea how to tell if these work or not. I'm not finding moths in the closets where I've stashed these repellents, but I'm seeing moths in other parts of the house. So I guess these are doing their job and keeping them out of the closet?\\n\\nI do like how these came with a pouch for each packet. It's very convenient to load and to hang all around the house. So far, I'm happy. It's brought the moths into the open so I can handle them.\",\n",
       " \"I really wish that moths were repelled by nice odors. These little sachets smell a lot like Lysol, which is somewhat obnoxious, but not as hideous as mothballs, and as far as I know, they should repel those nasty pests and eaters of my favorite wool suit.  I'm giving it a try in my cedar closet, and the downstairs hallway closet, where I suspect there might be a few moths making trouble.  These individually sealed sachets are supposed to be good for one month at a time after they are opened, so they have to be replaced frequently, which is not a terrible trade-off to avoid the stink of mothballs.\",\n",
       " 'These moth repellent packets are great.\\nI got them to put in all my closets to help with freshness, smell, and to repel moths. I just moved into my place, and it is an old building, and I have a lot of wool clothing, so I wanted to take a prevention stance in order to avoid moths!\\nThe smell is very pleasant and natural. The packets are small so easy to tuck away in a variety of places. It gives off a good odor for the closet but nothing overwhelming where it is getting into the clothes.\\nOverall so far I am happy with these! Time will tell if they repel moths. So far no sign of them!',\n",
       " 'These moth pouches are great.\\n\\nI really like that the active ingredients are Peppermint Oil, Cedarwood Oil, Clove Oil and Lemongrass Oil.  The inactive ingredient is Cottonseed Meal.\\n\\nI like that they smell good yet help repel moths and other insects.\\n\\nWe are using them in the closet and garage.\\n\\nI like that you get 10 packs in the box.  Also, there is a nice red velvet pouch for each packet so you can hang it and contain the scent so that it exudes slowly through the bag.\\n\\nI am pleased with this product.',\n",
       " \"This is an excellent set of 10 plant extract based moth repellent pouches.  They are individually packaged in sealed plastic, smell nice and also come with 10 small bright red non woven bags with draw string for hanging.  10 hanging bags seem to be a lot since I don't think I'll be using all 10 pouches at once.  In addition to hanging in closets I also like to place them in zipped plastic clothes storage cases just in case even though all the clothes inside have been washed.  Each pouch is supposed to last 30 days however hopefully in a sealed environment they may go a bit longer.\",\n",
       " 'When you have an antique radio collection and see paper moths, you start to worry, as many of the old tube type radios have paper parts. This set of mothball repellant is just what we need to help to keep them away.',\n",
       " 'If you need your sinuses cleared this will do the trick! All jokes aside, it’s strong. They come individually wrapped and you unwrap them and put them in the included pouch. I have a moth infestation so I’m trying everything to get rid of them and keep them out of my closet. I think this will do the trick in keeping moths and other insects out.',\n",
       " 'These work well and the smell is not too overpowering. Good alternative to the traditional balls.',\n",
       " \"I really appreciate that these are all-natural and do not leave my closet smelling strange or like I've used moth balls. I've only used them a short time, yet they seem effective so far.\",\n",
       " \"Seems to be keeping the moths away.\\nI put moth traps in the closet at the same time I put these out, and the traps haven't caught any here, but have caught dozens in other places in the house.\\nNot sure how long they'll last, but the multipack means I'll have coverage for months.\\nRecommend.\",\n",
       " 'I questioned whether these small packets would be effective in preventing infestation.  This time of year I am canning and processing veggies and fruit.  The day i received these sachets the gnats were already trying to swarm my peaches.  I placed a packet near the peaches to test efficacy.  24 hours I have no gnats or fruit flies around the peaches and other fruit.',\n",
       " \"I moved into a place that had cockroaches so I put these in the closet to repel them. They seems to work as I haven't seem any around the areas I placed them. I didn't bother using the velvet bags it comes with.\",\n",
       " 'These moth repelant bags smell much more pleasant than the standard mothballs. The bags are large, and you get red velvet bags to place the repelant bags into so the contents are not in direct contact with your clothes.',\n",
       " 'Easy to use and smell good! I used 3 at a time, ( I have a big closet) smell was not overwhelming.',\n",
       " \"These moth repellents are individually wrapped and accompanied by a bunch of small velvet pouches.  The pouches appeared sturdy, but I was curious if their material was thick enough to prevent the scent from escaping.  Upon opening one of the repellent packets, I was greeted with a strong Pine-Sol-like smell.  I placed it inside one of the velvet pouches and positioned them on either side of my walk-in closet.  Initially, the closet was filled with the Pine-Sol scent, which worried me about its potency.\\n\\nHowever, after leaving the house for a few hours to run errands and returning later, I was surprised to find that the strong scent had completely dissipated.  This left me questioning the repellent's effectiveness and longevity!  Given its ingredients—natural essential oils—I hoped it would prove gentle on fabrics while effectively repelling moths.\\n\\nOne drawback I encountered was with the packaging: some of the plastic bag seals on the repellent packets adhered tightly to the packet itself.  This meant that when I cut open the packet, I had to cut into the repellent packet as well.  While this issue was somewhat mitigated by placing the packet in a pouch, it would have been preferable if the seals were easier to manage without compromising the contents.\",\n",
       " 'These repellents smell fresh and for me, the scent is attractive and pleasant, but I am not sure how effective they are in repelling moths. I have them out and have seen pantry moths flutter around despite their presence.',\n",
       " 'I was skeptical at first, but these roach repellent pouches really work! I placed them in my kitchen cabinets and under the sink, and within a few days, I noticed fewer roaches. After a week, they were completely gone! No harsh chemicals, just a pleasant scent. Highly recommend for anyone dealing with pesky roaches.']"

      "These natural repellent sachets are generally well-received as an alternative to traditional mothballs, primarily for **moth prevention and repulsion**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key themes from the reviews include:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scent (Positive):** Many users praise the **pleasant, natural scent**, often described as a mix of peppermint, cedar, and other essential oils, which is a significant improvement over the chemical smell of traditional mothballs. Some found it fresh, like cologne, or \"mint-forward.\"\n",
      "*   **Scent (Negative/Polarizing):** However, scent is a polarizing factor; some find it **very potent, strong, or even overwhelming** initially, with descriptions ranging from \"Lysol-like\" to \"old people smell with peppermint,\" leading a few to dislike it or worry about clothes smelling too strongly. The scent can dissipate quickly for some, raising longevity concerns.\n",
      "*   **Effectiveness (Moths):** While many report them to be **effective in keeping moths out of closets and protected storage areas** – with some noting no new damage and empty moth traps in treated spaces – a few question their effectiveness in larger, open areas or for eliminating existing widespread infestations, sometimes seeing moths in other parts of the home. Some also noted they didn't work for pantry moths.\n",
      "*   **Effectiveness (Other Pests):** Notably, these sachets have shown **remarkable effectiveness against roaches** for several users, with reports of roaches disappearing within days or weeks. One user also found them effective against **gnats/fruit flies**.\n",
      "*   **Ingredients & Safety:** Reviewers appreciate the **all-natural, non-toxic ingredients** (typically peppermint, cedarwood, clove, and lemongrass oils) and their **safety around pets and in the home environment**, as a healthier alternative to harmful chemicals.\n",
      "*   **Packaging & Ease of Use:** The product is lauded for its **convenient packaging**, including individually wrapped sachets to retain potency and attractive red velvet drawstring pouches for easy placement and hanging. They are generally considered easy to set up.\n",
      "*   **Longevity & Replacement:** A recurring point is the **longevity of the scent and effectiveness**, with recommendations for regular replacement (around monthly) as the scent tends to dissipate over time, though some note it clears from clothes quickly.\n",
      "*   **Value:** Many consider it a good value, especially with the 10-pack offering extended coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** These sachets are a popular natural, non-toxic alternative for repelling moths and other pests (especially roaches) from specific areas like closets. While generally praised for their natural, pleasant scent compared to traditional mothballs, the potency can be a polarizing factor, and regular replacement is needed for sustained effectiveness.\n"

      "Gemini: Customers highly appreciate the following features of this product:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Pleasant, Natural Scent:** This is by far the most celebrated feature. Reviewers consistently praise its \"natural essential oil smell,\" describing it as \"mint-forward,\" \"peppermint and wood,\" \"cedar smell,\" or simply \"smells good\" and \"fresh.\" This is a significant improvement over the \"chemical-smelling\" or \"grandma smell\" of traditional mothballs.\n",
      "*   **Effectiveness against Pests:** Many customers report success in repelling moths, preventing damage to clothes, and even effectively getting rid of roaches, gnats, and fruit flies in localized areas.\n",
      "*   **Natural & Non-Toxic Ingredients:** Users highly value that the product is made with natural oils (peppermint, cedarwood, clove, lemongrass) and is \"non-toxic,\" \"safe around pets,\" and avoids \"potentially harmful chemicals.\"\n",
      "*   **Included Red Velvet Pouches/Sachets:** The accompanying red velvet drawstring bags are frequently mentioned as \"cute,\" \"convenient,\" \"well-made,\" and \"great for hanging,\" adding to the aesthetic appeal and ease of use.\n",
      "*   **Individually Wrapped for Potency:** The sachets being \"individually sealed in plastic\" is appreciated as it ensures they \"retain their potency until opened\" and are fresh for use.\n",
      "*   **Ease of Use:** Customers find the product \"easy to place,\" \"easy to use,\" and \"fast to set up,\" making it a hassle-free solution.\n",
      "*   **Excellent Alternative to Traditional Mothballs:** Many explicitly state that this product is a superior \"good alternative\" to mothballs, primarily due to its non-offensive scent and natural composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "You: Now, suggest me the improvement I can make in my product according to the customers feedback\n",
      "Gemini: Based on customer feedback, here are some actionable improvements you can make to your product:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Clarify Scent Profile & Offer Options (Addressing \"Too Strong\" / \"Aversion\" / \"Lysol-like\" Feedback):**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Provide more nuanced descriptions of the scent, perhaps detailing the individual notes (peppermint, cedar, clove, lemongrass) and their overall blend.\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Consider introducing a **\"milder scent\"** or **\"unscented\"** version if feasible, to cater to customers who find the current scent \"too potent,\" \"obnoxious,\" or have an \"aversion\" (e.g., \"old people smell with peppermint,\" \"Lysol-like\").\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Explicitly state if the scent is intended to transfer to clothes, and if so, how to mitigate it (e.g., \"Use the velvet pouch to minimize direct contact and scent transfer onto clothing\"). Some reviews contradict on scent transfer, so clarity is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Improve Clarity on Longevity & Replacement Cycle (Addressing \"Loses Scent After 1 Month\" / \"Questioning Effectiveness\" Feedback):**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Clearly state the expected lifespan of each sachet (e.g., \"Effective for up to 30 days after opening, replace monthly for best results\") on the packaging and product description.\n",
      "    *   **Action:** If a longer-lasting version is possible, research and develop it to reduce the frequency of replacement.\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Position the multi-pack as a cost-effective way to maintain continuous protection over several months, rather than just \"lasting years\" for one-time use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Enhance Packaging for Easier Access and Pouch Visibility (Addressing \"Missed Pouches\" / \"Difficult to Open Sachet\" Feedback):**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Redesign the interior packaging to ensure the red velvet pouches are immediately visible upon opening the box, rather than being \"at the bottom.\"\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Improve the individual plastic wrapping of the sachets so they are easier to open without the risk of \"cutting into the repellent packet itself.\" Ensure the seals don't adhere too tightly to the sachet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Refine Marketing for Repellency vs. Elimination (Addressing \"Moths Still in Other Parts of Home\" / \"Not Sure How Effective\" Feedback):**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Clearly articulate that the product is primarily a **repellent and preventative measure** for *localized areas* (closets, drawers, storage), rather than an eradicating solution for widespread or severe infestations throughout an entire home.\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Suggest complementary solutions like moth traps for identifying and managing existing infestations in other areas of the home, as some customers are already doing. Frame it as a comprehensive pest management strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Broaden Pest-Specific Marketing (Addressing \"Effective for Roaches/Gnats/Fruit Flies\" Feedback):**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Update product listings and marketing materials to explicitly mention effectiveness against **roaches, gnats, and fruit flies**, as many customers found it successful for these pests. This expands your potential market and highlights a proven multi-pest benefit.\n",
